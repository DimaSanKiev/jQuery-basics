// Problem: it looks gross in smaller browser widths and small devices
// Solution: to hide the text links and swap them out with with a more appropriate navigation

// Create a <select> and append to menu
// Cycle over menu links
    // create an option
    // option's value is the href
    // option's text is the text of link
    // append option to select
// Create button
// Bind click to button
    // go to select's location
// Modify CSS to hide links on small width and show button and select
    // also hides select and button on large width and show's links
// Deal with selected options depending on current page
